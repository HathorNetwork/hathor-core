# Hathor Nano Contracts IDE

A complete Remix-like development environment for Hathor nano contracts, providing a full-featured web-based IDE for developing, testing, and deploying nano contracts without requiring a full Hathor node.

## 🚀 Features

- **Web-based IDE** with Monaco Editor and Python syntax highlighting
- **Real-time validation** of nano contract rules and syntax
- **Local execution engine** using the complete Hathor nano contracts implementation
- **Interactive testing environment** with balance simulation and debugging
- **Contract templates** and examples
- **Deployment integration** with Hathor testnet/mainnet
