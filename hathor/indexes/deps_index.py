class DepsIndex(BaseIndex):
    """ Index of dependencies between transactions

    This index exists to accelerate queries related to the partial validation mechanism needed by sync-v2. More
    specifically these queries:

    - Which transactions need to be downloaded next? That is, all the transactions which are a reverse dependency of
      all the transactions that aren't fully validated;
    - Which transactions can we validate next? That is, all the transactions which are not fully validated but can be
      fully validated because all of its dependencies have been downloaded and are now fully validated;

    These queries would normally need traversals that are at the very **least** O(N) with N being the total number of
    transactions in the blockchain. The specific speed up with the index varies but should at **most** O(M) with M
    being the total number of transactions in the index.

    Terminology:

    - a tx is ready: said when all of its dependencies are in storage and are fully-valid
    - (direct) dependencies of tx: all transactions that tx needs to be validated, which are its parents and its inputs
    - reverse dependencies of tx: all transactions that depend on tx for being validated, that is if tx1 depends on tx2
      and tx3, and tx4 depends on tx3 and tx5, the reverse dependencies of tx3 would be tx1 and tx4.
    - needed transactions: all transactions which need to be downloaded (we also store which tx asked for a transaction
      to be downloaded)


    Examples:

    - Consider the following complete DAG (it doesn't matter if a tx is a block or not):

               +----------------v
      A -----> B -----> C ----> D
      +--> E --^        ^
           +------------+

      These are all the dependency relations (direct/directly is implied, as shown on the first examples):

      - A does not have any (direct) dependency
      - A is a reverse dependency of B and E
      - B (directly) depends on A and E
      - B is a reverse dependency of C and D
      - C depends on B and E
      - C is a reverse dependency of D
      - D depends on B and C
      - D does not have any reverse dependency
      - E depends on A
      - E is a reverse dependency of B and C

      These are some alternative ways to express some of those relations:

      - the list of reverse dependencies of A is [B, E]
      - the list of (direct) dependencies of B is [A, E]

    - The "needed" and "ready" concepts should be easier to understand, but are harder to ascii-draw, thus I skipped
      them.
