class ConsensusAlgorithm:
    """Execute the consensus algorithm marking blocks and transactions as either executed or voided.

    The consensus algorithm uses the metadata voided_by to set whether a block or transaction is executed.
    If voided_by is empty, then the block or transaction is executed. Otherwise, it is voided.

    The voided_by stores which hashes are causing the voidance. The hashes may be from both blocks and
    transactions.

    The voidance propagates through the DAG of transactions. For example, if tx1 is voided and tx2 verifies
    tx1, then tx2 must be voided as well. Another example is that, if a block is not in the bestchain,
    any transaction spending one of the block's outputs is also voided.

    In the DAG of transactions, the voided_by of tx1 is always a subset of the voided_by of all transactions
    that verifies tx1 or spend one of tx1's outputs. The hash of tx1 may only be on its own voided_by when
    tx1 has conflicts and is not the winner.

    When a block is not in the bestchain, its voided_by contains its hash. This hash is also propagated
    through the transactions that spend one of its outputs.

    Differently from transactions, the hash of the blocks are not propagated through the voided_by of
    other blocks. For example, if b0 <- b1 <- b2 <- b3 is a side chain, i.e., not the best blockchain,
    then b0's voided_by contains b0's hash, b1's voided_by contains b1's hash, and so on. The hash of
    b0 will not be propagated to the voided_by of b1, b2, and b3.
