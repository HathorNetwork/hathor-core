        """ This method is called only once when a new block arrives.

        The blockchain part of the DAG is a tree with the genesis block as the root.
        I'll say the a block A is connected to a block B when A verifies B, i.e., B is a parent of A.

        A chain is a sequence of connected blocks starting in a leaf and ending in the root, i.e., any path from a leaf
        to the root is a chain. Given a chain, its head is a leaf in the tree, and its tail is the sub-chain without
        the head.

        The best chain is a chain that has the highest score of all chains.

        The score of a block is calculated as the sum of the weights of all transactions and blocks both direcly and
        indirectly verified by the block. The score of a chain is defined as the score of its head.

        The side chains are the chains whose scores are smaller than the best chain's.
        The head of the side chains are always voided blocks.

        There are two possible states for the block chain:
        (i)  It has a single best chain, i.e., one chain has the highest score
        (ii) It has multiple best chains, i.e., two or more chains have the same score (and this score is the highest
             among the chains)

        When there are multiple best chains, I'll call them best chain candidates.

        The arrived block can be connected in four possible ways:
        (i)   To the head of a best chain
        (ii)  To the tail of the best chain
        (iii) To the head of a side chain
        (iv)  To the tail of a side chain

        Thus, there are eight cases to be handled when a new block arrives, which are:
        (i)    Single best chain, connected to the head of the best chain
        (ii)   Single best chain, connected to the tail of the best chain
        (iii)  Single best chain, connected to the head of a side chain
        (iv)   Single best chain, connected to the tail of a side chain
        (v)    Multiple best chains, connected to the head of a best chain
        (vi)   Multiple best chains, connected to the tail of a best chain
        (vii)  Multiple best chains, connected to the head of a side chain
        (viii) Multiple best chains, connected to the tail of a side chain

        Case (i) is trivial because the single best chain will remain as the best chain. So, just calculate the new
        score and that's it.

        Case (v) is also trivial. As there are multiple best chains and the new block is connected to the head of one
        of them, this will be the new winner. So, the blockchain state will change to a single best chain again.

        In the other cases, we must calculate the score and compare with the best score.

        When there are multiple best chains, all their heads will be voided.
