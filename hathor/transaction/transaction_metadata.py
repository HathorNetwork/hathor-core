        -> Checkpoint: is a block which hash matches a known checkpoint is a parent of a Checkpoint-valid tx
    - Basic
        -> Full: all parents reached `Full`, and validation+consensus ran successfully
        -> Invalid: all information to reach `Full` was available, but something doesn't check out

        -> Checkpoint-Full: when all the chain of parents and inputs up to the genesis exist in the database
    - Full: final
    - Checkpoint-Full: final
    - Invalid: final

    `BASIC` means only the validations that can run without access to the dependencies (parents+inputs, except for
    blocks the block parent has to exist and be at least BASIC) have been run. For example, if it's `BASIC` the weight
    of a tx has been validated and is correct, but it may be spending a tx that has already been spent, we will not run
    this validation until _all_ the dependencies have reached `FULL` or any of them `INVALID` (which should
    automatically invalidate this tx). In theory it should be possible to have even more granular validation (if one of
    the inputs exists, validate that we can spend it), but the complexity for that is too high.
